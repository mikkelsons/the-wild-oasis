# The Wild Oasis

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/29063a4c-3127-4787-8470-c1c3401d936f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/mikkelsons-fast-react-pizza/deploys)

This is a modern, responsive web application for managing a hotel business. Authorized users can login and see current bookings, check guests in and out, update cabins, create new authorized users, and update their own name, password, and avatar image. This project was built as part of the Udemy course "The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More" by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### To do:

There is currently no functionality in the app for adding new bookings. There is also no functionality for updating bookings (number of guests, number of nights, etc.). Both of these could conceivably be done with the same interface, perhaps a modal like the add/update cabins.

Authorized users can delete bookings, but it might be better to archive bookings so that they are no longer visible in the application but remain in the database. Currently deleting a booking deletes it from the database.

There are undoubtedly many more possible enhancements, but this is just a show project.
